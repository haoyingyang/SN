This project is about Amazon’s co-purchase network; i.e., which products are purchased together on Amazon. There are two data files: “products.csv” and “copurchase.csv”. “products.csv” contains the information about the products. “copurchase.csv” contains the co-purchase information (i.e., if people bought one product, then they also co-purchased the other).
